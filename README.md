# Lab 9: GCM Analysis & Bias Assessment

**Date:** October 27, 2025 | **Module:** 2 | **Week:** 9

## Overview

This lab introduces students to working with Global Climate Model (GCM) outputs for hydrological applications. Students will learn to download and process GCM climate data, assess statistical biases compared to observations, and force hydrological models with raw GCM data to understand the need for bias correction.

## Topics Covered

- Downloading GCM data from climate data repositories
- Statistical bias comparison between GCM outputs and observations
- Forcing hydrological models with raw GCM data
- Understanding systematic biases in climate models
- Data processing workflows for climate datasets

## Objectives

- Download and process GCM climate data
- Assess statistical biases in GCM outputs
- Force hydrological models with raw GCM data
- Understand the limitations of raw climate model outputs

## Connection to Problem Sets

This lab builds the GCM data processing skills that students will need for PS2 Task 3, establishing the foundation for understanding climate model outputs and the necessity for bias correction in impact studies.
