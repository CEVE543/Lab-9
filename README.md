# Lab 10: HMM & NHMM Implementation

**Date:** November 7, 2025 | **Module:** 2 | **Week:** 12

## Overview

This comprehensive lab covers both basic Hidden Markov Models and their non-homogeneous extensions for climate change applications. Students will implement HMMs from scratch, extend them to time-varying parameters, and apply climate change scenarios for future weather generation.

## Topics Covered

- 2-state HMM implementation from scratch
- Parameter estimation using EM algorithm or maximum likelihood
- Non-homogeneous HMM extensions with time-varying parameters
- Climate change parameter perturbation strategies
- Synthetic weather generation and validation for current and future climates
- Multi-scenario ensemble generation

## Objectives

- Implement 2-state Hidden Markov Model from scratch
- Extend to non-homogeneous HMM with time-varying parameters
- Apply climate change parameter perturbation strategies
- Generate synthetic weather sequences for hydrological modeling
- Validate weather generation models against observations

## Connection to Problem Sets

This lab builds the comprehensive HMM toolkit that students will use for PS2 Tasks 5-6 (HMM weather generator, climate scenarios, and uncertainty analysis), providing both basic and advanced weather generation capabilities in one integrated lab.
